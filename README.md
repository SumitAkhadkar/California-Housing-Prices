# California Housing EDA


## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the California Housing dataset. The California Housing dataset is a popular dataset for practicing data analysis and machine learning techniques. It contains data on various attributes of houses in California and their corresponding median house values.

The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, relationships, and potential outliers, and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling.

## Dataset

The California Housing dataset can be found in kaggle or at the following link:

## Repository Contents

- `California-Housing-Prices.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code.
- `housing_data.xlsx`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `README.md`: This documentation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In the `California-Housing-Prices.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, you will find the following EDA tasks:

1. Data Loading: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Exploration: Get an overview of the dataset's structure, including data types and missing values.
3. Data Visualization: Create various visualizations to understand the data, such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
4. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale/normalize data if necessary.
5. Statistical Analysis: Perform basic statistical analyses to extract insights from the dataset.

## Dependencies
To run this EDA project, you will need the following dependencies:

1. Python 3.x
2. NumPy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
6. Jupyter Notebook
